**A NOTE ON MATERIAL SELECTION**

We chose these materials because they are simple to order and come from
one supplier. As this design catches on, it's likely that McMaster-Carr
will struggle to keep up. We encourage you to find alternative
suppliers. Many different clear plastics will work, even transparency
film! Many foams will work and glue can be substituted for adhesive
backing. We know this can be daunting, but you can do it. Use your inner
MacGyver!
