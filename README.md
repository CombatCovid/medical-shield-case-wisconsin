MANUFACTURING RESOURCES
-----------------------

If your organization would like to make shields and has the capacity to make 500+, please follow these steps:

[1] Design: [Click here](https://www.delve.com/assets/documents/Open-Source-Face-Shield-Drawing.pdf) to see our open-source design drawings, list of materials, steps to make, etc.

[2] Estimate Materials: Estimate how much plastic, elastic and foam you'll need using the Excel calculator [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1L9VQEoSpmXU5nLVl8aJKQYLhiapN16yA).

To make use of this calculator follow these simple steps: 

-   Download document
-   You can then change the desired number of shields. Notice that this calculator was done using the specifications from the [Open Source Face Shield](https://www.delve.com/assets/documents/Open-Source-Face-Shield-Drawing.pdf)
-   If you need to modify the dimensions, you can do so in the corresponding field
-   The summary chart includes the weight of PET shields, foam and elastic strap needed (in short tons)

[3] Suppliers of Materials: Contact the suppliers of plastic, foam and elastic we've compiled in our Supplier Databases below. Feel free to add supplier quotes yourself so others can see.

[4] Assembly: We recommend setting up a controlled manufacturing environment that reduces the risk of spreading the virus. For example, regularly wipe down work surfaces with disinfecting wipes, wear gloves, maintain proper social distance between workers, etc. Contact your local hospital and/or look online for more guidance and see our legal disclaimer at the bottom of this page.

[5] Ship to those in most need:

Option #1: Reach out to your local / regional hospitals to assess their need and work through their infection control process.

Option #2: When you have 100+ completed face shields ready to ship, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSei2ti1aSj4e6Ky4TcPaLFfp8aa2n8TOHItIFKsD-DritAZeg/viewform). The team will reply with contact / shipping info for those in the most need at that time. You can negotiate price directly with the hospital in need. 

Here are some drawings to work with: [pdf drawing 1](https://www.delve.com/assets/documents/OPEN-SOURCE-FACE-SHIELD-DRAWING-v1.PDF), ![Face Shield Drawing](https://making.engr.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1271/2020/03/OPEN-SOURCE-FACE-SHIELD-DRAWING-v1_Page_2-300x199.jpg), and [Face Shield Drawing v.1](https://www.delve.com/assets/documents/OPEN-SOURCE-FACE-SHIELD-DRAWING-v.1.pdf)


## About the project

Due to shortages, we have assembled a team from the [UW Hospital](https://www.uwhealth.org/), [UW Makerspace](https://making.engr.wisc.edu/), [Delve](https://www.delve.com/) and [Midwest Prototyping](https://www.midwestproto.com/) to design a medical face shield shown in the images above. The design is based on shields currently used in hospitals ([here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/y5euZdRz6aqEm8KZA)) using very economic materials and scalable, advanced manufacturing processes.

Our aim is to post on our website:

[1] Open Source Design: We've posted the open-source design and parts list [here](https://www.delve.com/assets/documents/Open-Source-Face-Shield-Drawing.pdf) and will update the design as we receive feedback and complete further testing. The blog post from Delve is [here](https://www.delve.com/insights/face-shield-designs-to-fill-the-gap). See legal disclaimer at the bottom of this page. If you would like to make shields yourself, please see the "[Manufacturing Resources](https://making.engr.wisc.edu/shield/#DIY)" sections below.

[2] Supplier Resources: A list of suppliers for plastic, foam and elastic. If you are a supplier or looking for suppliers, please see the "[Supplier Resources](https://making.engr.wisc.edu/shield/#supplier)" section below.

[3] Buyer Resources: A list of manufacturers and their expected production rates for making face shields. If you are looking for manufacturers selling face shields, please see the "[Buyer Resources](https://making.engr.wisc.edu/shield/#buyer)" section below. Note: We encourage you to pursue multiple sources since the supply of PPE is still very limited.

[4] E-mail List: An email list with healthcare facilities looking for face shields so we can notify them if we become aware of any developments. If interested, please fill out the intake form below.
