Manufacturing resources
-----------------------

If your organization would like to make shields and has the capacity to
make 500+, please follow these steps:

1\. Design: Click [here]((.../Open-Source-Face-Shield-Drawing-2.pdf))
to see our open-source design drawing. You can find the list of
materials, steps to make, etc. [here](.../docs/EN/03-Building.md)
[[https://www.delve.com/assets/documents/Open-Source-Face-Shield-Drawing.pdf]{.underline}](https://www.delve.com/assets/documents/Open-Source-Face-Shield-Drawing.pdf)

. Estimate Materials: Estimate how much plastic, elastic and foam
you'll need using the Excel calculator
[here](.../docs/EN/Face-Shield-Calculator-v2.xlsx).

To make use of this calculator follow these simple steps:

a.  Change the desired number of shields. Notice that this calculator
    > was done using the specifications from the Open Source Face Shield

b.  If you need to modify the dimensions, you can do so in the
    > corresponding field

c.  The summary chart includes the weight of PET shields, foam and
    > elastic strap needed (in short tons)

3. Suppliers of Materials: Contact the suppliers of plastic, foam and
elastic we've compiled in our Supplier Databases. Feel free to add
supplier quotes yourself so others can see.

4. Assembly: We recommend setting up a controlled manufacturing
environment that reduces the risk of spreading the virus. For example,
regularly wipe down work surfaces with disinfecting wipes, wear gloves,
maintain proper social distance between workers, etc. Contact your local
hospital and/or look online for more guidance and see our [legal
disclaimer]([[https://making.engr.wisc.edu/shield/\#Legal]{.underline}](https://making.engr.wisc.edu/shield/#Legal)).

5. Ship to those in most need:

Option #1: Reach out to your local regional hospitals to assess their
need and work through their infection control process.

Option #2: When you have 100+ completed face shields ready to ship,
fill out [this
form]([[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSei2ti1aSj4e6Ky4TcPaLFfp8aa2n8TOHItIFKsD-DritAZeg/viewform]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSei2ti1aSj4e6Ky4TcPaLFfp8aa2n8TOHItIFKsD-DritAZeg/viewform)).
The team will reply with contact / shipping info for those in the most
need at that time. You can negotiate price directly with the hospital in
need.
