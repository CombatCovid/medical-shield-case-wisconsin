# Note that it's critical that a metadata.yaml file _does not ever have_ this trailing ---
# The reason: this trailing separator says there's another block to come.
# For a Markdown fine, that's true -- the main Markdown text
# But in a pure Yaml file, there isn't more to come - and it will break because empty!
